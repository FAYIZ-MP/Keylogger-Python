# 💻 Keylogger using Python

This is a simple yet powerful keylogger built using the `pynput` library in Python. It seamlessly records keyboard strokes and logs them into a file (`keylog.txt`), providing an efficient way to monitor keystrokes.

## 🧿 Features
✔️ Captures and records all keystrokes into `keylog.txt`

✔️ Displays real-time keystrokes in the terminal (optional)

✔️ Runs in the background using a keyboard listener

✔️ Lightweight and easy to use

## 🛠 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the script using:

```bash
python keylogger.py
```
(Press ESC to stop recording keystrokes.)
Once executed, it will begin logging keystrokes into `keylog.txt` in real time.
